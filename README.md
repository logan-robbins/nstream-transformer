# nstream-transformer
Reference implementation of the N‑Stream Transformer: parallel multi‑role decoding on a single shared decoder, with Dynamic Notes Bus (DNB) and Shared Notes Cross‑Attention (SNC) for causal inter‑lane communication. Includes a paper‑aligned inference runtime and a lean PEFT‑ready training loop over GPT‑OSS trunks.
